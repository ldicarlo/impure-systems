Hey I am Luca, and I blog about children (I have two of 'em), and tech.

I am a software engineer, I have some good knowledge of pentesting, and I own [a company](https://north-devs.com) that provides French "freelancing" administration (Portage Salarial) which is a way to have an employee status (and perks) with a freelance autonomy in France.
